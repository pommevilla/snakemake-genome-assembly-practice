# Snakemake genome assembly practice

Practicing using Snakemake to:
* Download unassembled genomes from SRA using [SRA toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki)
* Quality control with [FASTP](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)
* Assembled genomes with [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades#sec3.1)
* Get genome assembly metrics with [CheckM2](https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2)
