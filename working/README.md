# working

This is the default directory for the pipeline that contains all of the intermediate files, such as the SRA prefetch files, fastqs, outputs from the various steps of the assembly pipeline, and the metrics. 
You can change this by changing the `directories/working_directory`. 
If you do so, make sure that the directories exist before running the pipeline.
